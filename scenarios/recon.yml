  # List of Monitoring units.
  #
  # EDURange is only able to capture traffic between monitoring units, not within.
  #
  # Use this fact when designing scenarios. A monitoring unit for competing players may be fine if
  # they are not allowed to communicate to each other.
  #
  # Each monitoring unit has a CIDR block which it occupies. This can range from
  # a /17 to a /27 on AWS (28 technically, but we cannot bridge VPCs using anything smaller
  # a /27 as we need to implicitely create a VPN/NAT subnet)
